# ETC5550: Retail Project

This repository contains the work and materials for the Retail Project in the ETC5550 unit (Applied Forecasting). 

The project's objective is to forecast real-time series data, specifically monthly retail trade volumes in Australia, using ETS and ARIMA models. The data is sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), with each student analyzing a unique time series correlated with their student ID.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Forecasting monthly retail trade volumes in Australia.
- **Data Source**: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
- **Models Used**: ETS and ARIMA.

## Data Analysis

### Initial Analysis

- **Statistical Features**: Examination of the original data's statistical properties.
- **COVID-19 Impact**: Analysis of the pandemic's effect on the retail trade volume.

### Data Preparation

- **Transformations and Differencing**: Explanation of the data preparation steps.
- **Unit-Root Test**: Incorporation and results of the unit-root test.

## Model Selection and Evaluation

### Model Shortlisting

- **Methodology**: Criteria for shortlisting ARIMA and ETS models.
- **AIC Values and Test-Set Results**: Discussion on model selection based on AIC values and performance on a 24-month test set.

### Chosen Models

- **ARIMA and ETS Models**: Details of the selected models.
- **Parameter Estimates and Diagnostics**: Overview of parameter estimates, residual diagnostics (ACF graphs, Ljung-Box test).
- **Model Comparison**: Analysis of which model provides better forecasts based on the test set.

## Forecasting and Results

### Out-of-Sample Forecasts

- **Forecast Production**: Point forecasts and 80% prediction intervals for two years beyond the data end.
- **Comparison with Actual Data**: Evaluation of forecasts against recent ABS data (Table 11).

### Model Assessment

- **Forecast Accuracy**: Assessment of the chosen models' accuracy.
- **Benefits and Limitations**: Discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of the models for the given data.

## Presentation of Results

- **Graphs and Tables**: All visuals are clearly labeled with appropriate units of measurement for clarity and precision.

## Conclusion

- **Summary**: Recap of the findings and the forecasting process.
- **Future Work**: Suggestions for further research or improvements in forecasting methods.
